This project involves enhancing the file system of the Xinu operating system to efficiently manage larger files. 
The enhancement includes implementing a Unix-like inode structure to replace the existing flat, non-hierarchical linked index block structure. 
This modification enables the file system to handle larger files using a hierarchical i-block structure with direct, singly indirect, and doubly indirect.
